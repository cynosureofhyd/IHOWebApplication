    <h3>William Kimbel</h3>
    <div>
        Kimbel, who moved to ASU with the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) in 1997, is Virginia M. Ullman Professor of Natural History and the Environment in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and Director of the Institute of Human Origins. He conducts field, laboratory, and theoretical research in paleoanthropology, with primary foci on Plio-Pleistocene hominid evolution in Africa and the late Pleistocene of the Middle East.

        Recent field work has taken Kimbel to the Hadar hominid site in Ethiopia, where he has codirected paleoanthropological research since 1990, and to northern Israel, where he has collaborated with Israeli colleagues on the excavation of Middle Paleolithic cave deposits. His lab-oriented interests are in the evolution of hominid skull morphology and function, variation, and systematics and the concept of the species as applied to paleoanthropological problems. Since 1989, Kimbel has been Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator on eight National Science Foundation and other research grants totaling $775,000.

        Kimbel was Joint Editor of�Journal of Human Evolution from 2003–2008.

        ASU courses taught by Kimbel include "Fossil Hominids," an upper-division undergraduate survey of the fossil evidence for human evolution; "Primate Paleobiology," graduate seminar (team-taught with Prof. Kaye Reed); and "Paleoanthropology," also a graduate seminar.

        In 2003, Kimbel mentored his first PhD student, Shara Bailey, who completed a dissertation entitled " Neandertal Dental Morphology: Implications for Modern Human Origins."

        In the Department of Anthropology (the predecessor to the School of Human Evolution and Social Change),� Kimbel served as Director of Graduate Studies from 1999–2003. In 2005, Kimbel was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    <h3>Donald Johanson</h3>
    <div>
        In today's scientific community, few men have created the kind of excitement and controversy that Donald Johanson has brought to the field of paleoanthropology. His 1974 discovery of the world's best-known fossil, "Lucy," brought him the kind of attention usually reserved for rock stars. His name became synonymous with a new understanding of our human origins.

        Johanson's book, LUCY: THE BEGINNINGS OF HUMANKIND, winner of the 1981 American Book Award in Science, intimately chronicles his discovery of the remarkable 3.2 million-year-old Lucy skeleton and highlights its importance for comprehending who we are and where we came from.

        Human ancestor finds far more ancient than Lucy have been recovered, but she remains the benchmark in paleoanthropology by which all other discoveries are judged. Lucy has become a household name, a cornerstone in human evolutionary studies, and continues to inspire expanded exploration and discovery of our ancient ancestors.

        Johanson's career, now spanning 30 years since he received his PhD from the University of Chicago, has led him to undertake field explorations in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Eritrea, and most recently Iran. His undying thirst for pursuing a more comprehensive understanding of how humans came to be was sparked as a young teenager growing up in Hartford, Connecticut when he first read Thomas Henry Huxley's book, MAN'S PLACE IN NATURE. He is profoundly committed to the notion that we cannot fully grasp who we are as a species until we have a more complete knowledge of our evolutionary roots.

        Currently, Johanson is Founding Director of the internationally respected Institute of Human Origins, a human evolutionary think tank he founded in 1981. The Institute combines interdisciplinary expertise to conduct, interpret, and publicize scientific investigations of the human career. Through research, education, and sponsorship of scholarly interaction, IHO fosters the pursuit of integrated solutions to the most important questions regarding the course, cause, and timing of events in human evolution.

        At present, Johanson's primary goal is to further IHO's prominence by attaining a position of world leadership in the study of human origins and evolution. An important element for achieving this goal is his current effort to consolidate the Institute in a building on the Arizona State University campus where he holds the Virginia M. Ullman Chair in Human Origins.

        Johanson is a frequent lecturer at universities and other forums, worldwide. He has coauthored six books now available in ten languages and has published in the National Geographic Magazine and innumerable scientific journals. Johanson hosted and narrated an Emmy nominated, three-part PBS/NOVA series titled IN SEARCH OF HUMAN ORIGINS. His current, state of the art web site is the premier web site in the world on human evolution: www.becominghuman.org. He is an Honorary Board Member of the Explorers Club where he was recently awarded the Explorers Club medal—the highest honor that the club can bestow; a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; and many other professional organizations and is the recipient of several international prizes and awards.

        Johanson believes that, "Understanding who we are is not just a matter of idle curiosity. It is a matter of survival for our own species as well as for the millions of other species with whom we share Earth. For without a clearer understanding of who we are, we will fall far short of the kind of future we would want for ourselves and for our children. We are an unprecedented and totally unanticipated species, and hopefully an awareness of the deep biological roots we share with one another and the rest of nature will point us in the direction of our best dreams rather than our worst nightmares."

        Curtis Marean
    </h3>
    <div>
        Professor Marean received his PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 1990 and is now a member of the Institute of Human Origins and School of Human Evolution & Social Change at Arizona State University. His research interests focus on the origins of modern humans, the prehistory of Africa, the study of animal bones from archaeological sites, and climates and environments of the past. In the area of the origins of modern humans, he is particularly interested in questions about foraging strategies, for example, when humans became effective hunters of large antelope, and the timing and processes underlying the evolution of modern human behavior. Professor Marean has a special interest in human occupation of grassland and coastal ecosystems and the role people play in the form of these ecosystems.

        Professor Marean's primary methodological approach to investigating these questions is zooarchaeology, the study of animal bones, and taphonomy, the study of how bones become fossils. In particular, Professor Marean focuses on experimental taphonomy and the replication of bone destruction processes with the goal of refining zooarchaeological methods. His work in this area has had a profound impact on zooarchaeological methodology and our understandings of Neanderthals and early modern human hunting behavior. He, along with his student Yoshiko Abe, have developed a novel image-analysis zooarchaeological recording system that utilizes GIS software. This approach is a substantial improvement in zooarchaeological methodology.

        He is currently directing archaeological excavations, with Peter Nilssen, at Mossel Bay in South Africa. The sites are mostly large caves in the steep coastal cliffs above the Indian Ocean. These excavations are targeted at refining our understanding of the origins of modern human behavior and placing that event in its environmental context. To that end, he is a leading a team that is seeking to develop a continuous sequence of environmental change from 400,000 to 30,000 years ago. This will have implications for our understanding of modern human origins but also will inform us on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to potential long-term climate change and thus be directly relevant to the future of humanity in the light of future climatic shifts.
